			<p>The Icelandic horse is a breed of horse developed in Iceland. Developed from ponies taken to Iceland by Norse settlers in the 9th and 10th centuries, the breed is mentioned in literature and historical records throughout Icelandic history. Icelandic horses are long-lived and hardy. Icelandic law prevents horses from being imported into the country and exported animals are not allowed to return.</p>
